## Goodput measurement

Goodput is the fraction of elapsed time during which a training job is making useful progress (i.e. not stalled, restarting, or doing overhead work). A `GoodputMeasurement` resource watches a `Job`'s pod logs in real time, applies regex patterns from a `LogProfile`, and computes the ratio.

### LogProfile

A `LogProfile` (cluster-scoped) defines named regex capture groups that match log lines from a training framework. The goodput calculator uses the captured timestamps and step counts to determine when the job was making progress.

Built-in LogProfiles installed by `nvcrectl setup init`: `megatron-training`, `megatron-bridge`, `nccl-bandwidth`, `nccl-loopback`.

### Measurement lifecycle

While the measured `Job` is running, the measurement's `Measuring` condition is `True` and every value in its status — including `result` — is **provisional**: it is recomputed on each sampling pass and changes as the run progresses.

When the `Job` reaches a terminal state, the controller performs one final log read and folds it into a single terminal status write, anchored to the timestamp of the Job's terminal condition rather than the controller's wall clock: `completionTime` is the Job's terminal transition time, and `trainingTimeSec` (and therefore `result`) is measured up to that instant. That write sets `Complete=True` and `Measuring=False`.

Once `Complete` is `True` the measurement is **frozen**: its status never changes again, so `nvcrectl certification report` returns the same goodput on every read, and controller restarts or repeated reconciles cannot move the value (see [ADR-072](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cluster-readiness-engine/blob/main/docs/designs/072-goodput-terminal-freeze.md)). Goodput-based threshold evaluation (`goodputRatio`, `avgTFLOPsPerGPU`, `avgStepTimeSec`) waits for `Complete=True` and only ever consumes the frozen values.

### Interpreting goodput

A goodput ratio of 1.0 means the job was making continuous progress. Values below ~0.95 indicate meaningful overhead — stalls, restarts, or slow nodes.

## Bandwidth measurement

A `BandwidthMeasurement` resource watches a `Job`'s NCCL log output and computes per-bus bandwidth metrics for collective operations (all-reduce, all-gather, alltoall).

### Thresholds

Each catalog entry defines expected bandwidth thresholds per GPU architecture. A `Job` that fails to meet its threshold is marked failed, which propagates up through `Workflow` to `Certification`.

### Report

`nvcrectl certification report` and `nvcrectl workloadrun report` display measured vs. expected bandwidth with a pass/fail indicator per collective operation.

## CPU-GPU C2C measurement

`C2CMeasurement` is a dedicated measurement type for coherent CPU-GPU memory.
The GB10 benchmark measures direct GPU access to CPU-initialized memory and CPU
access to GPU-produced memory using managed and mapped pinned allocations. It
verifies every transferred byte and records bandwidth and latency by direction,
allocation type, and size.

This is distinct from MNNVL and NCCL bandwidth. MNNVL is a GPU-to-GPU NVLink
fabric spanning nodes; GB10 uses NVLink-C2C inside each processor and
ConnectX-7 RoCE between cluster nodes.
